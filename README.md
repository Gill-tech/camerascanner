CamScanner Object for Images - Machine Learning Project
Welcome to Day 3 of my machine learning journey! 🚀 In this project, I've developed a CamScanner Object for images using Jupyter Notebook and explored powerful libraries like NumPy, Matplotlib, and OpenCV. 📸

Project Overview:
This project focuses on transforming images into high-quality scanned documents. Leveraging various image processing techniques, I've implemented functionalities such as image resizing, shaping, edge detection, and contour extraction.

Technologies Used:

Python 🐍
Jupyter Notebook 📒
NumPy 🧮
Matplotlib 📊
OpenCV 🖼️

Project Highlights:
Image Resizing and Shaping: Efficiently prepare images for processing.
Edge Detection: Detecting edges to enhance document features.
Contour Extraction: Identifying and extracting contours for precise document boundaries.

Dependencies Installation:
pip install numpy matplotlib opencv-python

Project Structure:
CamScanner_Object.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing the project code.
